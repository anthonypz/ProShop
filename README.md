## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Bootstrap UI, Redux Toolkit

This project was built using the MERN stack. In addition to that, the user interface was built using the React Bootrap UI library. Redux Toolkit was used for global state management, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and HTTP-Only cookies for authentication, and Mongoose ODM for modeling data.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this ecommerce platform from scratch using the MERN stack has been an exciting learning experience. These are some of the key lessons I've learned while working on the project:

- Redux Toolkit for state management: While challenging to set up, Redux made it easy to manage complex UIs and data flows. By using Redux Toolkit, I was able to streamline my development process by calling my backend API endpoints easily and improving code organization.
- JSON Web Tokens for authentication: JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties. By using JWTs, I was able to implement secure authentication and authorize access to protected resources without the need for complex server-side logic or database queries.
- Mongoose for modeling commerce data: Using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling toolkit, I was able to easily model my ecommerce data in a way that was flexible and efficient. With Mongoose, I could quickly prototype and iterate on the data models without getting bogged down in the details of database schema design.
